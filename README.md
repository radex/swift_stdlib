swift_stdlib
============

Xcode-generated headers of the Swift standard library — updated with every beta.

To compare the stdlib headers between 2 betas, go to:

https://github.com/radex/swift_stdlib/compare/6.1-beta1...6.1-beta2.diff

And replace `6.1-beta1` and `6.1-beta2` with the two versions you're interested in. Versions are labeled like so: `6.0-beta2`, `6.0-gm`, `6.0`. To see all the version tags, see https://github.com/radex/swift_stdlib/releases.

Note that at the moment, the order of function overrides appears quite random — that's why in every beta there's a lot of lines changed, but there are usually few actual changes hidden in the noise.

In addition, [Swifter](http://swifter.natecook.com) is a handy reference which
provides auto-generated documentation for the Swift stdlib, with the ability
to switch between versions.
